This Excel sheet is designed to help students track their courses, grades, and progress towards their degree - before their hair turns gray from stress! ðŸ‘´

4. Start adding your courses on the Courses tab
5. Watch your summary dashboard update automatically (Ooooh, magic!)
6. Customizing the Template

8. Edit the minimum credit thresholds on the Summary tab
9. Add additional requirements like internships, research, selling your soul, etc.
10. Change the year and semester names to "Year 1", "Year 2", etc since no one understands the system anyway
